# Java Swing Calculator Application
The Java Swing calculator app works by:
 * Creating the Interface:
  It uses Swing components like JFrame, JTextField, and JButton to create the visual representation of the calculator with a display field, number buttons, operator buttons, and other controls.
 * Handling User Input:
  When a button is clicked, the ActionListener interface is used to detect the event.
  The code then processes the input (numbers and operators) and updates the display field accordingly.
 * Performing Calculations:
  When the "equals" button is clicked, the calculator:
  Retrieves the first number and the operator.
  Gets the second number from the input.
  Performs the calculation based on the selected operator (+, -, *, /).
  Displays the result in the display field.
 * Managing State:
  The calculator keeps track of the current input, the selected operator, and the result internally.
  This allows it to maintain the state of the calculation and perform subsequent operations correctly.

In essence: The calculator app acts as an intermediary, translating user interactions (button clicks) into internal calculations and then displaying the results in a user-friendly format.
